     <p>What a stunning villa!, the ultimate luxury,  my family and I had such a relaxing time during our stay at The Luxe Bali. Wayan, Dewa, and Frankie were very attentive and made sure we were well fed and comfortable during our stay, we couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>
The facilities were immaculate and so well put together you certainly have a keen eye for design, this is certainly a villa we would highly recommend to our friends and family as well as considering returning in the future to celebrate Chinese New Year.  Thanks to everyone that has made our stay so pleasant and enjoyable. </p>
<div class="name">Tao Hsu Hwa and Family.  China  December  2017</div><hr />
<p>
We have stayed in many five-star places all over the world now after our stay at The Luxe Bali we can say we have stayed at a 10 star place, it is the superlative of superlatives.
</p><p>
The design of the villa goes beyond description, we appreciated all the attention to each design detail and the beautiful and clever functionality of each feature is unbelievable.This is only surpassed by the tasteful décor throughout.  The pool view of the ocean, the penthouse terrace, the peaceful and well-maintained rainforest, and all the other gardens where to stop they are all so beautiful.
</p><p>
One very appreciated feature is the iPad full of music, such a tasteful library we enjoyed listening to something new every day, and we could not forget the home theatre, what a special treat, it felt as if we were in a private cinema, but the final crowning feature to help make the Luxe villa a 10 star was the staff.
  <br />
  The Butler managed every detail along with the staff who took care of all our needs before we even knew we had one. The Chef was amazing, what a treat, every meal was a delicious new adventure never before experienced, and he patiently accompanied us to the market and explained everything to us, thanks to Mr
Frankie for also helping to make a birthday celebration even more special.  Miss Wini and Tini performed the best massages we have ever had, we only wish we would have had even more, but next time. 

<p>In summary this must be the best and most relaxing holiday we have ever had due to the villa, the location , and the staff,  We are already planning our return. 
  One very special thank you to the owners for making this villa available to us and to all the staff visible and invisible. The Gardeners, Security, and so on, the complete package of a 10 Star stay.   
<div class="name">Whitney Martha. USA Nov 2017</div><hr>

<br />
Travelling with a young child there was no request that was too hard andwe were made to feel right at home. thank you all and we look forward to visiting again soon.<br />

Many Thanks for a wonderful family vacation with my daughters and grandchildren this is a spectacular villa on an absolutely enchanted island.
<br />
Of our many trips over the decades we have fallen in love with The Luxe Bali and thank you for allowing us to visit your home. May blessings be yours and your family’s reward for sharing. Wayan and the staff were professional and caring,  they are the best ambassadors for Bali and you. Yours Truly,<br />
<br />
<div class="name">Shirley Larkin.  Atlanta  USA  October 2017 </div><hr />

<p>From the moment we arrived it was smiling faces and warm hearts. Our stay here has been fantastic, the Villa is exceptionally well designed and maintained, Frankie is the best chef ever,  the meals were most enjoyable. Wayan was always there for us with a smile and service. When asked to do extra for our guests it was done with his smile and never a problem.  </p>
<p>Dewa, Wini and Tini made our stay so relaxing from cleaning our mess up to making us feel like a million dollars. Looking after Xanthe (our little one) was something they enjoyed as did she.  This has been the best holiday made possible by fantastic staff, great location, and a villa that works,  it is Bali at its finest. Many thanks, </p>

Every detail is perfection, the location is dreamy, the staff are incredible, the food is amazing, the villa is luxurious and all your needs are met. We would like to thank the Luxe Bali team from the bottom of our hearts for their incredible service and attention to details. </p>
<p> As a gluten-free vegetarian I was amazed at all the yummy and healthy food options made available to us, the foodwas so good we did not eat outside the villa once. Next year we will bring our children back and we cannot wait to step back into this slice of heaven again.  Thank you and until next time. </p>

    <p>Words can never do justice to the amazing perfectness this of this villa. We had the most
wonderful 10 days while staying at The Luxe Bali villa. A very special thanks to
Wayan,  Frankie and Winnie they really did everything to make us feel welcome and
at home. It was a great experience for us to see how life is at Bali which is so
different from what we are used to in the Netherlands.<br> Thanks for everything
and with the best regards. </p>
<div class="name">Baz and Marianne Bakker, Netherlands November 2016</div><hr />

<p>Villa The Luxe Bali is an absolutely breathtaking place to be, with gorgeous view of the beach below and nearby bars and restaurants it is an accessible place to everything.  
The facilities in the villa are definitely abundant from pools that overlook the beach to a sauna and steam bath. <br>
The service of the villa is without a doubt one of the best there is. Everyone made my stay
feel like I was home; I can say for sure that this stay felt like a home away
from home. Breakfast was amazing with the vast variety. Most definitely I will
come back for a longer period of time in the future with more friends to enjoy
this one of a kind accommodation, and I would like to thank everyone in the villa
from making my stay amazing. Thank You so much. Sincerely.</p>

<p>Our stay at The Luxe Bali was everything we had hoped for and more. The  location is
amazing and the villa has been built to perfection, every detail has been well
thought out and the staff are fantastic and were so great with our young
children. They really made our stay here fantastic.  The food Frankie prepared for us was
delicious and Wayan and Dewa ensured all our needs were taken care of.  
It was great having the spa and Wini  and Tini provided great treatments. Our stay
here was perfect and we wish we could have stayed longer,  we look forward to returning again soon. </p>

    <p>Since the very first moment we entered the house we knew that we had made the right choice.  The house is astonishing, we all fell in love with it at first sight. 
It perfectly fits our style…. Details, concept, music, decorations,  the garden,  and the staff is amazing.
<br>
They were all very kind and willing to help in every moment. We love the fact that you can walk only barefoot in the house since we are used to do that also at home.  We love that you paid such attention to details as a sound system all over the house, completely equipped spa with therapists daily available.  Great cinema, fish pond in dinning room, speakers outside disguised as stone to hide in the perfect garden,  and from what we read in the magazine that everything was planned and done in an eco friendly and sustainable way. We loved the fact that the water for the house is collected and filtered from rain.  Thank You for a wonderful holiday.           </p>

    <p>We had the most fantastic and relaxing holiday.  The villa is thoughtful and the views are stunning, the whole experienced was made all the better due to the wonderful welcoming and always smiling and helpful staff who made the villa feel like a home from home. Chef Frankie’s food was gorgeous and he catered so nicely for our kids as well. I thoroughly recommend The Luxe to my friends. Thanks again to Wayan and Dewa, nothing was too much trouble.<br>
My daughter and I thoroughly enjoying the massages from Tini and Wini, thanks again to everyone. Oh and I would love to have your nut bread recipe - it’s amazing. Regards,</p>

Thank you for letting us stay at your perfect house had a perfect location the ocean view is magnificent and spend hours staring at the gorgeous night sky. We can  see that the house is a labor of love from the outdoor tiles that keep cool despite the heat to the drinking water from the tap’s. Perhaps this house can be featured in the next Miami Vice. Food has been absolutely delicious and we were amazed by Chef Frankie’s versatility. Thanks again to the wonderful staff that made our stay truly remarkable, we do not wish to leave. Yours Sincerely,</p>

<div class="name">Heather Whiteford,  Vail  Colorado June 2016</div><hr /><p>

My husband and I stayed with our two children at the Luxe Bali villa for nine days... unfortunately it was not long enough ! .  From the moment we arrived we were immersed in the beauty, luxury and amazing feel of this gold gem.<br>
 
The views from every room are simply breathtaking. The grand design and sense of space has a unique ability to make you feel completely relaxed and in permanent holiday mode.<br>
 
Our children loved the diversity of our own private pool as well as the large cliff edge infinity pool, the beautiful sharing staff were in absolute delight and made our stay extra special. Wayan Frankie Dewa, Wini and Tini are all wonderful warm friendly polite people whom we grew very fond of by the end of our stay. They were fabulous with our children aged 10 and 7.  Frankie is a very talented chef and we were amazed by his fabulous culinary skills!. <br>
 
We cannot wait to return hopefully in the not too distant future. Warm Regards</p>
<div class="name">Simon Murphy  Geelong Australia  June 2016</div><hr /><p>

Our 5 nights stay at The Luxe Bali was beyond our expectations, as nice as the website is it can't fully express the quality of the experience to be enjoyed. Being a contractor I always look for shortcuts in materials and labor in the finished product, I can honestly say I couldn’t find any. It's obvious that a quality-finished product was foremost in your construction. One of our main concerns always when travelling is the water for consumption, it was comforting to know about your purification system and we would have no concerns drinking it or eating food washed in it. I am a partner in another business called Oregon Rain where we harvest rainwater in the state of Oregon and bottle as drinking water so I know about water quality in processing methods. Wayan and the other staff were amazing, they made every effort to accommodate any request we had and help to rearrange our outings to work around the traffic concerns. We look forward to a return trip and won’t hesitate to recommend it to friends. Until next time.</p>
<div class="name">Dan Boyd.   Oregan USA  June 2016</div><hr /><p>

Thank you so very much for the warm and friendly service extended to us during our stay. We appreciate the privacy that this home affords us and therefore we are able to truly relax and given the facilities never had to leave the building during our stay.  All staff are to be commended on their exceptional talent to ensure our stay was most enjoyable. Kind Regards, </p>

The Luxe Bali is one of the most amazing places not only in Bali but also in the world! Everything has been created consciously and carefully in extraordinary detail. The beyond first class accommodations are matched with a staff that is superb. The blissful and peaceful feeling of the space and its surroundings has been so profound I can truly say it was a once in a lifetime experience that I hope to repeat some day.</p>

What an amazing holiday we had our first holiday is the couple and for Arief his first holiday in 11 years. The Luxe Bali is truly paradise the natural beauty the amazing facilities the décor all of the details were noticed in appreciated the design workmanship and materials used all so well thought out. Each day we will discover a new piece of art or a table or rug we admired. The staff were outstanding in their service kindness and friendliness we consumed nearly every ending the Indonesian dish on the menu and Arius and I did cook has learnt many new recipes and fallen in love with Bali flavors Frankie is very creative talented and willing to share his talent as well as learning other cuisines.
Wayan and Dewa were always available and helpful and we learnt so much about Bali and the culture and traditions from them. We took full advantage of the Spa, Wini and Tini are great therapists.
I myself travel to Bali 5 to 6 times a year and in the past 10 years I have never had any experience to match the Luxe Bali.</p>
I will return to Singapore and the rest to Sydney, we hope to return with the children together as we share our journey as a newly formed family early next year. We appreciate you opening your home and it was an honor and effortless to stay at this amazing haven.Yours Sincerely,</p>

If you are questioning whether to book The Luxe Bali stop and book as fast as you can. While booking from our website so far away gave us a sense of pause the villa and experienced told us we had made the right decision right from our entrance through the front door. They took their time building this home and it shows, I’ve had my share of experiences with other luxury homes and the Luxe Bali meet and exceed them in many ways. The layout is thoughtful and the art and furnishings complete the style. Not only do you have a quiet and cool shaded pool at your disposal you have access to the larger infinity pool and separate lap pool.  The beach access is perfect to slip into the warm what is during low tide.
Wayan and the team were excellent; they were there when you needed them and not when you did not need them. The food was great; we mixed it up with a selection of Western and Indonesian fair. Our driver was great for getting us around for errands and sightseeing. The massages and treatments were great and so convenient in the dedicated spa space.  We are sad to say goodbye as we head to our next destination but we hope to return to the beauty of The Luxe Bali again in the future. </p>

We look forward to coming back again someday.</p>

Last minute invitation to Bali.  But it was the best decision. The house is fabulous – understated luxury throughout.  Made very special by the great staff. Beautiful views from everywhere.  Great beds and pools. The kids loved the movie theater and yoga room.  The driver was excellent and taught the traditions, and me a lot about Bali, which is one of the things I enjoy most about foreign travel.</p>

The Luxe Bali far exceeded any expectations we had about a week in Bali. Following the building progress of this stunning property has now been an absolute pleasure to finally experience what The Luxe is all about. Attention to detail, complete comfort,  ultimate luxury, world class staff, and location, nothing is missing !
<br /> 
Every room in this home is thought out so you can relax and take in the incredible view over Padang Padang Beach and beyond.  All the staff here will ensure that you have everything you need and more,  and all with a smile.
<br /> 
Frankie will dazzle you with his exceptional culinary skills and can create almost anything you desire.  We wish we could take Wayan and the team back home with us. We have loved every minute of our time here and could not recommend The Luxe enough for a totally memorable holiday in the ultimate Bali accommodation.  Thank you to you all.

Too Good to be True!. There really are no words photos or videos to do this place justice. We stayed here for seven days and the only fault was that we did not want to go home. We never had to leave during our stay nor would we want to as everything is right at your fingertips.
<br />
From Wayan the butler, the chef, spa therapists, three pools, gym, sauna, cinema room, lots of places to lounge, Padang2 Beach right below, the amazing views from any direction you are looking at, plus the attention to detail that is gone into every single aspect of the property all wrapped into one. You truly have to be there to experience how great it is. The Luxe Bali is definitely beyond five star and is the best house I have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend it and it is definitely value for money, you will not find another place like it.

What a memorable an incredible stay it has been. The villa and experience here exceeded our expectations from the moment we arrived. The staff are very friendly and the service is top class. They are always happy to help out with any request we had. 
<br />
Chef Frankie made top-quality very delicious food. We would definitely recommend anyone staying here to try his Indonesian meals and deserts. The villa has everything you need from swimming pools, day spa, sauna, cinema room, and amazing views of the ocean.  We really felt like we never needed to leave. We couldn't have asked for anything more and will definitely be back.  Thank you for the amazing experience.

The Luxe villa exceeds expectations. From the stunning ocean views to the delicious cuisine, our stay in this exquisite villa will be unforgettable. The staff were more than caring and always knew when to offer us another refreshing coconut or supply us with an incredible amount of natures fast food- the fruits.<br />
Thanks to Wayan and his team including the talented chef Frankie for the highest quality meals and preparing the best Indonesian cuisine we have ever tasted.<br />
A week in this villa was the best way to recharge our batteries and finally feel relaxed. The beauty in the views, design, feng shui and comfort of this house has inspired us for future travels and adventures. The best of Bali is most definitely found in the stunning villa. Lots of love and happiness for the future.

Thank you for making our stay here and holiday beyond amazing. The staff have been great, attending to our every need. The food and service has been spectacular. We absolutely fell in love with this villa and ambience with stunning views. We hope to make this a home away from home when we come to visit Bali. We love you so much we are also planning on making it a wedding venue destination for next year. All us girls love the spa facilities, we couldn't get more than enough use for the sauna and steam room along with all the massage girls, they have been so sweet.
<br />
What you have achieved here is quite remarkable a combination of tranquility and luxury all wrapped into one package. We had fairly high expectations when we arrived and I am pleased to say they have been amply fulfilled.  Would we come back ?  In a heartbeat ! 
<br /> 
Thank you for allowing us to be your guests here, we consider ourselves to be somewhat fortune. Credit to the team that looked after us during our 6 days here, they were simply outstanding. Discrete, attentive, and extremely polite, they are a credit to you. Having lived in Indonesia for a year and having the luck to experience the warmth of the people here, you have found some of the best. Many thanks from all of us.

Fantastic amazing and magnificent. The staff are around for our every need but you don't see them, everything we wanted was organized. This villa has amazing attention to detail in every way. Each member of staff fulfilled their duties and more, from lunch to a glass of water, to a towel to flip-flops, they never ever disappointed.
<br />
"Food Food Food Glorious Food" Exquisite! Thank you for a gourmet food experience from start to finish.
<br />
I will find it hard to leave and won't stop boring all my family and friends on this little bit of paradise, and will recommend them to try what I was so lucky to experience. A big thanks you to you all, and the lovely person who created this peaceful haven.

I really don't know where to start or end firstly I would like to say that we have all thoroughly enjoyed our stay it was a truly memorable experience and one by which all others will be judged I must also congratulate you on the team you have assembled, we really didn't notice the staff were around unless of course you needed them then they magically appear, everything seem to just happen but I can't remember seeing any of it. Wayan is a very cheerful and attentive young man; he seems almost disappointed when we didn't need anything from him. Chef Frankie is a wizard, he has a special touch, whatever he cooks just melts in your mouth. We would all come back just for his cooking. The girls were like ghosts, possibly more like cleaning fairies, I have no idea when they made the beds. Dewa must be the happiest person I have come across, his smile is infectious. 
<br />
Now to the house … What a magnificent backdrop to the whole shebang, you should be extremely proud of your creation, the layout, the finishes, the attention to details, the splendor in the gardens, the views, the sunsets, the world class waves out the front … Honestly all I can say is Thank you it's been an unforgettable experience and we will be back as soon as possible.

Thank you for making our stay here and holiday beyond amazing. The staff have been great attending to all our needs. The food and service has been spectacular. We absolutely fell in love with this villa and ambience with stunning views. We hope to make this a home away from home when we come to visit Bali again. We love it so much we also plan on making it our wedding venue destination for next year. All our girls (Bukowski Sisters) love the spa facilities, we couldn't get more than enough use for the sauna and steam rooms along with all the massage girls,  they have been so sweet. Again we thank you so much for making our stay here great and we will see you again next year for our wedding.

We have fallen in love with the villa and the great location with such a wonderful view. The staff has been wonderful and very attentive, the food was fantastic, no need to go out for dinner. We can't wait for the return trip next year.  Thanks all of you for the great time.

This house is your own five-star hotel exclusively for yourself, the house itself is stunning, views are breathtaking, and the staff are exceptional. This house is a credit to its creator everything has been thought out to the tiniest detail. Love that you can drink and brush your teeth with the treated water. This is a place where you can arrive and stay put, no need to look for things to do, there are three pools to use, a cedar wood sauna, steam room and private spa for your massages. Your own gold class theatre room for movie nights, great surf breaks, and swimming beaches out the front, and the best chef ever to cook your meals.  Really worth the money to stay, we were so lucky to secure a last minute booking and definitely the best place we have stayed in Bali (and there have been a lot). Already trying to work out when we will be able to return.

Our previous stays in Bali have been for a surf based holidays, this was the first time we had brought our young children we also invited my mum who had a very active 70 years of age has never been to Bali.<br />
Our stay at the villa has been one of our great experiences together, the residence in itself is truly amazing, the owner has been able to strike the perfect balance by creating a level of luxury and quality that is surely second to none in Bali. While maintaining a sense of comfort and friendliness that has us all at ease and relaxing during the whole state.<br />
The crystal clear water and sensational local foods are unique and give a level of peace of mind when travelling with young children. The location in the cliff tops above the Padang2 surf break is world class and the view is one that can only be done justice by experiencing it.<br />
Through the course of the day the locations character changes, the late afternoons are quite simply amazing.  Thank you to the great staff led by the ever smiling Wayan, our family had a wonderful memorable experience.

A Super yacht on land, the best of the best. Since 1974 I have stayed in many places in Bali and this is the best I have ever experienced the Luxe is beyond five-star, it has every luxury with incredible style, every aspect has been thought through.  Balancing the environment with our creature comforts, my wife and children all agree with my summation and can't wait to return again.

Congratulations you have an amazing villa, after days I still remain speechless with this paradise and how lucky we are to have landed here. Your villa is astonishing and equally important, inspiring.  Good for the heart and soul.<br /> 
From the path down to the sea, the gardens, the surroundings, the view and all the colors. The villa and its interior all beautifully done with superb taste.<br />
You have made our holidays unforgettable and we do have to come back every year. My mother-in-law my wife and the three little children loved every second of it. Special thanks to Wayan, always very pleasant and always giving excellent attention.

Wow thank you Luxe Bali, I have never felt so relaxed, everything is so flawlessly comfortable and beautiful.  Wayan the butler and the other staff have been so attentive, no request is too big or small, so very happy to assist.<br />
The eye for details in the house (which speaks for itself) and Gardens is still amazing me at every turn of the head. So many areas to sit and ponder from the views of the ocean and bay, to the tranquil gardens and ponds. On my holiday here at I can honestly say that there is nothing I am wanting for, every need has been met, Thank you all, I will be back.

The Luxe Bali villa would be the most luxurious and serene location I have ever stayed in. From the incredible locally inspired artworks and tasteful décor to the peacefulness of the tropical gardens. The attention to details is endless everything about the Luxe Bali is at a level I have never experienced in Bali before.<br />
Wayan and his team were extremely attentive; nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel extremely pampered and comfortable. All of these elements combined to have made an unforgettable stay. Thank you all so much, we will definitely return.

This is the best place we have ever stayed when we travel abroad. Great villa, nice view, super service, nice rooms, and everything we received. Very good service from Wayan & his team daily.  They are so friendly.  We like the pool very much, also the garden, the dinner served by your local team was good!  <br />
You must have spent a lot of time to build this villa, we like the style. We have to leave today will definitely come back again some day, all the best.

We cannot speak highly enough of Wayan and his team nothing was ever too much trouble and everything that you did for us was done with kindness enthusiasm and a smile we look forward to returning to your lovely villa in the future.

Congratulations on an amazing home, your attention to details are exceptional and add to the experience of staying in a slice of paradise. Your team of people makes you feel so welcome, and the service makes you not want to leave.
<br />
To be able to simply relax amongst the beautiful gardens yet have access to every imaginable comfort has truly made our family holiday one to remember. Our only problem now will be trying to better it. I think this will be a challenge that we will struggle to achieve. This is our first trip to Bali we are so thrilled about the friendliness of it's people and it's casual and laid-back approach to everything. I hope we get the opportunity to come back. Bali will be certainly on the list. Many thanks again.

Thank you to The Luxe and the fantastic staff for making an amazing holiday. This is a unique inspiring home set amongst magical surroundings with expansive views. The attention to details is truly outstanding, from lush tropical gardens to lavish furnishings and unique Bali design.<br />
The staff was extremely attentive and caring.  The spa is a place of sanctuary to indulge all you needs and relax.  Overall the villa is modern Bali fusion with impeccable state-of-the-art facilities. Thank you for the memories, we will see you again to make more.

It's all about the ambience, the special feel of the Luxe Bali that's fine, but the real proof for me is the efficiency. The Luxe Bali has achieved something that no one else could, attention to details is over and above what you would think possible in the most luxurious houses anywhere in the world but to achieve this degree of excellence in Bali is unheard of.  I would recommend The Luxe Bali to anyone who needs to be pampered by attractive staff with state-of-the-art electronics to go stay, enjoy and chill out in one of the most beautiful places in the world.

Upon entering the Luxe Bali villa the first feeling is one of serenity and refinement. You have stepped into another world, you have arrived. You enter through a beautiful water-garden of fountains and koi ponds surrounded by lush foliage and old banyan trees that bring to mind an Angkor Wat Temple, a sanctuary.
<br />
Living Stonewalls is covered with dollar vines and antique carvings and the huge gong announces your arrival. The handsome staff is there to greet you, their presence and service is quiet and impeccable.
<br />
Every detail of the Luxe Bali villa has been thoughtfully planned, from custom high end art lighting, to warm timber and travertine floors. Furniture of cinnamon wood and ikat materials creates a Zen feeling of contentment, while the sounds of the ocean is like a mantra luring you to peace and adventure. 
<br />
The villas 3 pools are each unique, The white marble plunge pool is coolest under the lush umbrella tree, while the cliff edge infinity pool seamlessly connects to the horizon, the basalt lap pool is framed by flowering halyconia and magnificent wall carving waterfalls.
<br />
Heavenly and enchanting - down the stairs or elevator brings you to the gym, home theatre room and the sauna, haman & spa where Wini and Tini are waiting for you with an extensive spa menu as scents of lavender & sandalwood ease mind and body.
<br />
Undiluted Indulgence - in the golden granite kitchen, Frankie, Wayan and Dewa are preparing fresh fruit smoothies, croissants and cappuccinos. An outside dining table is set with origami napkins and freshly picked flowers, everything is exquisite.
<br />
From every window dramatic volcanic views of the coastline encompasses giant rocks and caves with glistening tide pools and endless perfect waves making one feel timeless and blissful.
<br />
Happiness, love, joy, monkeys frolic in the magnificent umbrella trees, the chanting of a temple ceremony on the beach can be heard, the air is frangipani and ocean, all your senses flow into peace and relaxation, objectless focus, memories, magical and mystical dreams of Bali. Terima Kasih. ( Thank You ).

My wife and I stayed at this property in September and absolutely loved the place, it was perfect for us. We stayed for a week and only went into town one day to catch up with friends; everything we needed or wanted was available for us at the property. I have a disability but had no problems at all as the place is equipped with elevators, which was fantastic, it is often difficult to find good properties that are wheelchair friendly. We loved the sunsets and the butler knew exactly the right time to bring our drinks up to the balcony that had a view to die for. We strongly recommend this place for a luxury holiday.

My family (wife, 2 daughters & son-in-law) and I were greeted by Wayan, "The Butler" with a cold drink and warm towel to refresh. Followed by the introduction to the house staff. A tour of the facilities in the Villa, unpack and time to relax. Beautiful bedrooms, with on suite (spa bath), with views! First decision is the evening meal...local or western? The chef is superb! A plunge pool, a lap pool or the infinity pool...you decide where to relax. A workout in the gym, a massage or just a snooze on one of the sun lounges...you decide. My youngest daughter loved the theatre room, movies, music seated in comfort. The calm of the surroundings, no "Kuta" crowds, no "car/bike" noise, just the serene piped music (or no music)..... Relaxing.. Close enough for shopping but far enough away to miss the crowds. The Villa blends in with the cliff and surrounding vegetation, great place for us all to relax, that is why we returned in June 2014 for another 2-week stay...planning another stay soon! Love the place and the staff, much better than 5 Star!

Perfection. My family and I stayed in this oasis for 10 days earlier in the year and are due to return in the next couple of months. I don't even know where to start in in describing how incredible it is before you notice the breathtaking views over Padang Padang Beach, the architecture and design which used natural materials with ultimate respect, or furnishings that have obviously been considered to the deepest of detail for your luxury, you notice the reception of the staff- so warm, friendly and approachable. Before long you completely sink into their comfortable hospitality being fed delicious and healthy meals by the talented chef and staff, and the delighting in daily spa treatments in the pamper room on the bottom floor (right next to the gym and movie room).  The tranquility of the pools and gardens, and the constantly changing colors of the ocean and landscape as the sun moves through the sky keeps you mesmerized in a deep state of relaxation throughout your stay. You will not be disappointed, you will not want to leave without arranging a time to return.
