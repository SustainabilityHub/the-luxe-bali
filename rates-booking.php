    		<h1>VILLA RENTAL TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
        	<h2>The terms and conditions below are applicable to rental reservations made with THE LUXE BALI</h2>
        </div>

		<div id="main-content">

    			<div class="overthrow nano-content description">
<p><b><h2>Booking Terms & Conditions</h2></b>
Booking a Villa is quite different from booking a hotel room or a packaged tour, especially with regard to payments and booking cancellations. Please do read the following booking terms and conditions including its 23 points carefully.<br /><br />
BLV Luxury Villas Ltd (UK, Company Registration: #08416593), and PT Luxury Bali Villas (Indonesia, Company Registration: #2208177004579), further named "BLV" both act as rental agents for the Villa and its Owners or their representatives further named "OWNERS" in arranging the bookings for furnished and staffed vacation rental villas. Each time a Guest confirms a booking of a Villa through BLV, either directly or through a travel AGENT, a Rental Contract is entered into between OWNERS for the provision of an accommodation for the agreed rental period, and the Guest in whose name the booking is made, further named the "GUEST". The GUEST must be at least 18 years of age at the time of booking, and guarantees that it has the authority to accept on behalf of himself and all members of his party these Terms & Conditions. If the Booking confirmation is done through a travel AGENT chosen by the GUEST, it is deemed that the travel AGENT has informed the GUEST of these Terms & Conditions, and the travel AGENT guarantees that the GUEST has agreed to them.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Booking Invoice</b>: Upon receipt of a booking request, BLV will issue and E-mail on behalf of the OWNERS a Booking Invoice to the GUEST or his travel AGENT (if the GUEST has chosen to book through such AGENT), indicating the Villa Name, the Name of the GUEST, the Rental Beginning (Arrival Date) and Ending Dates (Departure Date), the total number of persons in GUEST's party, the services included, and the total Rental Amount including applicable taxes and service charges. The Booking Invoice is generally issued by PT Luxury Bali Villas for Indonesian residents, and by BLV Luxury Villas Ltd for Non-Indonesian residents, and contains the specific and only valid version of these Booking Terms & Conditions which supersedes any other version. BLV's E-mail to the GUEST or its travel AGENT, containing the Booking Invoice is sent from the domain "@<a href="http://baliluxuryvillas.com" target="_blank">baliluxuryvillas.com</a>" and is signed and authenticated by <a href="http://baliluxuryvillas.com" target="_blank">baliluxuryvillas.com</a>'s public DKIM cryptographic key (<a href="http://www.dkim.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dkim.org/</a>).</li>
<li><b>Booking Confirmation Deposit</b>: To confirm a Villa Booking the GUEST must make a Booking Deposit to BLV within 5 working days of the Booking Invoice issue date, either directly or through his travel AGENT. If the below booking deposit payments are not received in time, BLV will void the booking request. The following booking deposit amount must be received by BLV:<br /><br />
For rentals where the Arrival Date is 61 days or more after the Booking Invoice issue date, a Booking Deposit of 50% of the rental amount must be paid.<br />
For rentals where the Arrival Date is 60 days or less after the Booking Invoice issue date, the total rental amount (100%) must be paid as a Booking Deposit.<br />
The Payment of the Booking Deposit constitutes the acceptance by the GUEST of these Booking Terms & Conditions.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><b>Balance Payment</b>: Where a 50% deposit applies to the booking, the GUEST must pay the remaining 50% balance of the rental amount not less than 60
days before the Arrival Date stated on the booking invoice.</li>
<li><b>Booking Acceptance</b>: On receipt of the Booking Deposit, BLV will E-mail a Booking Deposit Receipt to the GUEST or his AGENT on behalf of the OWNERS.
This is the formal acceptance by the OWNERS and BLV of these Booking Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li><b>Cancellation</b>: A cancellation fee equal to 50% of the total rental amount will be charged on any full or partial booking cancellations made by the GUEST 61
days or more prior to the Arrival Date. If the GUEST's cancellation is made within 60 days of the Arrival Date, a cancellation fee equal to 100% of the total rental amount will be charged. If payments are not received on or before the due dates as required herein, the GUEST will be deemed to have cancelled the booking, in which case the Rental Contract will be thereby terminated without any further notice required. Please note our recommendation below to take out a travel insurance policy that would cover the GUEST in case of a cancellation due to personal unexpected circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Booking Amendments</b>: Once a Booking Confirmation Deposit has been received, a fee will apply to each amendment made upon GUEST's Request. Please note that reducing the Rental Period is not an amendment but a partial cancellation. BLV and the OWNERS will do their best to accommodate any reasonable amendment, but the GUEST should be aware that some amendments might not be possible. When such an amendment is possible, related amendment fees are determined on a case by case basis. Typical fees range from 50 to 100 USD.</li>
<li><b>Travel Insurance</b>: BLV strongly recommends that the GUEST takes out a comprehensive travel insurance at the time of booking to protect the GUEST and all those accompanying the GUEST for the full time of the GUEST and party visit against illness, including evacuation, injury, death, loss of baggage and personal items, theft, cancellation and other travel contingencies. Please note that transportation is supplied by providers who operate independently of BLV and BLV assumes no responsibility, therefore, for any loss, injury, or damage to person or property due to acts of those providers. The Villa rental contract does not include any Travel Insurance.</li>
<li><b>Substitution</b>: In the unlikely event that the OWNERS are unable to provide the GUEST with the Property booked by the GUEST, BLV will inform the GUEST or its travel AGENT at the earliest possible date. BLV reserves the right to transfer the GUEST and their party to an alternative Property of similar type and value, in consultation with the GUEST and the OWNERS. If comparable accommodations are not available or acceptable to the GUEST, the OWNERS will refund the GUEST of all prorated rent and tax paid for the original villa. Under no circumstances shall the OWNERS or BLV liability to the Guest exceed the amount paid to the OWNERS for the rental period.</li>
<li><b>Payment Methods</b>: Payments can be made by Bank Wire Transfer or Credit Card Debit Authorization for Visa, Master and AMEX Card.<br /><br />

<b>Payment by Bank Wire Transfers</b>: all bank transfers must be effected in the currency indicated in the Booking Invoice. All bank transfer fees are to be charged to the Guest's bank account or his travel AGENT including correspondent bank charges. The GUEST or his AGENT must E-mail a copy of the bank
wire transfer to <a href="http://billing@baliluxuryvillas.com" target="_blank" />billing@baliluxuryvillas.com.</a><br />
<b>Payment by Credit Card Debit Authorization</b>: available by Visa, Master and AMEX Card. BLV's Banks will apply Surcharges for payment by Visa and
Master card and AMEX card. Applicable surcharges are indicated in the Booking Invoice. For all Credit Card Transactions BLV requires a photocopy of GUEST's Credit Card, both front and back with the Credit card numbers printed clearly, a photocopy of GUEST's passport picture page, together with a signed Debit Authorization Form, returned by facsimile or E-mail to enable BLV to complete the Credit Card transaction. All Credit Card payments in Indonesia are required under Indonesian Law to be converted into the local Rupiah (IDR) currency. Credit card payments are calculated on the banks exchange rate on the day of processing. For this reason, in periods of important currency fluctuations, BLV may advise the GUEST to privilege Bank Wire Transfers over Credit Card payments.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Rental <b>Check-in</b> time is 2:00 pm and <b>Check-out</b> time is 11:00 am. BLV will work with the OWNERS to try to accommodate the GUEST's actual arrival and departure times, subject to availability. A surcharge of 50% of the daily rate is applied for check-out from 11:00 am until 6:00 pm and full one daily rate if check-out after 6:00 pm. This surcharge will be included on the Booking Invoice. For a last minute late check-out request, if such a request can be satisfied, the payment can be settled by credit card or cash at time of departure.</li>
<li><b>Price Fluctuation</b>: Once the GUEST's booking is confirmed, the price of the villa rental is fully final, except if any government or regulatory body imposes new taxes which were unknown at the time of booking confirmation. BLV will inform the guest or its travel AGENT promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any such taxes will apply to the GUEST's booking.</li>
<li><b>Additional Expenses</b>: The cost of electricity, water, cleaning and garden supplies, and local taxes are included in rental rates. There are generally no additional costs, surcharges, taxes & service charges, staff salaries, or management fees above the price indicated in the Booking Invoice unless otherwise stated in the Booking Invoice. All villa rental rate inclusions are noted on the Booking Invoice. Typically telephone, meals, laundry and other provisioning costs will be the GUEST's responsibility. The staff at the Property may accommodate any reasonable requests to purchase food and drinks on the Guest's behalf, and this will be charged to the GUEST. Chefs will require an advance payment for both grocery shopping and beverages. GUEST shall pay them directly. Gratuities for household staff are encouraged and normal, but are left entirely to the GUEST's discretion.</li>
<li><b>Damages, Losses</b>: The GUEST is responsible for leaving the property in good order and in a clean condition. The GUEST further undertakes to pay for any damage or losses incurred during occupation. The management company reserves the right to repossess the property if the GUEST or a member of the GUEST's party has caused excessive damage or mess to the property.</li>
<li><b>Valuables and Security</b>: Any GUEST valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the GUEST's own risk. Neither BLV, nor the OWNERS accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to GUEST property. The GUEST is responsible for the Villa during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises, even when security staff is provided. Any act or omission by the GUEST, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Villa's insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the GUEST's responsibility.</li>
<li><b>Use of Villa & Guest Registration Form</b>: The villa provided is only for the use of the persons named by the GUEST on the guest registration form without exceeding the total number of persons indicated on the Booking Invoice. Subletting, sharing or assigning is prohibited and will be deemed as a breach of contract and all guests may be asked to leave the villa without any claim for compensation. Any persons not named on the guest registration form will, in all cases, be asked to leave the Villa by the Villa Manager. The GUEST shall use and occupy the Villa as a private residence only, and for no other purposes, including business, trade or professional use. Illegal and immoral practices in the Villa are strictly prohibited. The GUEST must restrain from any act on or in the Villa which contravenes any of the laws of Bali and Indonesia. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</li>
<li><b>Quiet Enjoyment</b>: BLV and the OWNERS wish to maintain a family atmosphere for the quiet enjoyment of Guests. OWNERS rent to family groups and responsible adults only. If in the reasonable opinion of the OWNERS or BLV, the GUEST or any member of his party behaves in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause danger, unlawful behavior, upset or distress to any third party or damage to property, BLV and the OWNERS are entitled, without prior notice, to terminate the stay of the GUEST concerned. In this situation, the GUEST concerned will be required to leave the accommodation or other service. BLV and the OWNERS will have no further responsibility toward such GUEST. No refunds will be granted and neither the OWNERS nor BLV will pay any expenses or costs incurred as a result of the termination.</li>
<li><b>Parties or special functions at the villa</b>: If the GUEST is planning to hold a dinner party or special function exceeding the maximum number of guests indicated in the Booking Invoice, please ask BLV for assistance since functions or parties require special permission from the OWNERS and the local community. Charges apply depending on size of function, catering company and equipment required. For larger functions, extra costs may apply such as special permit fees and extra staff hire. Please contact BLV for more details & special requirements.</li>
<li><b>A Security Bond</b> in form of a Credit Card Debit Authorization form is necessary for any damages or unpaid telephone, food, laundry and car tour charges incurred by the guest during their stay. This security bond will be used to cover all additional expenses incurred on the Guest's behalf , and to cover the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Villa its vehicles or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period.</li>

In the event of such an occurrence, BLV shall give prompt written notice thereof to the guest and any time for performance of an obligation shall be extended by time equal to the length of delay attributable to such occurrence. In no case will BLV or the OWNERS individually or collectively be liable to make any payment or give any refund or compensation of any amount over and above the total rental amount paid. BLV does not provide "Package Holidays" that would include non-local transport such as flights or ferries. When applicable, the GUEST is deemed to be aware of GUEST's rights under the Consumer Protection Regulations 2000/2334 and European 97/7/EC directive (see: <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.legislation.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu" target="_blank">http://eur-lex.europa.eu</a>) in respect of distance contracts.</li>

Should the GUEST have a problem with the Villa during the Rental Period, he must inform the OWNERS or BLV immediately who will endeavour to rectify the issue. In order for the GUEST's complaint to be addressed, the GUEST must communicate any problem whilst on location and also send an E-mail detailing the complain to reservation@baliluxuryvillas.com. However, no refund or rate adjustment shall be made for unforeseen technical failures such as the supply of telephone service, internet service, pool filtration systems, hot tubs, air conditioning, television or cable service, appliances, etc. If no complaint is reported during the Rental Period, BLV and the OWNERS will assume that the Villa was to the Guest's satisfaction and no complaint will be entertained.</li>
<li><b>Use of information given by GUEST to BLV</b>: In order to process the booking, BLV will need to collect and process personal information, such as GUEST names addresses or passport numbers. BLV may pass on only the necessary information to the companies and organizations that need to know them to provide the included services or additional services contracted by the GUEST (for example the OWNERS or the Villa Staff, VIP immigration fast track services, transport companies, credit/debit company or bank). Where you provide us with personal information, you consent to this information being used as described in this clause. BLV and its Concierge Service may also send you information about products and services that BLV think will be of interest to you. BLV may do this by post, telephone, SMS or email.
