<h2><b>Important Note :  Care of the Residence and Guest Liability for Damages</b></h2>
<p>
<b>Waxed Timber Floors.</b><br>
For your aesthetic and tactile enjoyment the residence is primarily high quality waxed timber floors. 
Because of this only soft soled shoes and sandals may be worn in-house. The shoes and sandals worn inside are not to be worn outside as they may pick up grit that can scratch the floors . We also supply in-house soft soled sandals and you are welcome to bring your own. Absolutely No High Heeled Shoes Allowed at any time. Soft soled raised wedges used only in-house are permissible.  
<br /><br />
The timber floors must also not get wet , please ensure you have dried yourself and your dripping clothing sufficiently after swimming in the pool or surfing before walking on the floors . Towels are provided for this purpose , and floor matts are at every entry point to help dry feet. If the floor gets wet then immediately drying them will be result in no further problem. Please do not leave wet towels or wet clothes on the timber floors. All Bathrooms, Kitchens and Terraces  are non slip marble/granite  floors and are ok to get wet.  
</p><p>
<b>Carpets , Sheeting, Furniture and Art.</b>  <br> 
All are  custom made / commissioned and are quite valuable. 
Please be aware of children using marking / ball point pens and other potential marking media around furniture, bed linen and art. For small children please bring waterproof nappies/diapers as the persian carpets are old and expensive. 
Failure to follow the above procedure and damage occurs to the floor will result in a total re-sanding of the damaged floor and repair or replacement of furniture at the guests expense. In stating all of the above regarding damage and liability, a claim has only happened once for a guest who insisted on wearing high heels and damaged the floor.  Guests who treat the residence with a normal level of care will have no problems whatsoever, even with small children.
