    <p>Dear Visitor, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in The Luxe Bali and warmly welcome you to our website.</p> 
<p>
Within the programming of this website we have attempted to as best as possible reproduce the calm, subtle, and understated luxuriousness of The Luxe Bali.  For maximum effect it is best viewed on a desktop or laptop using a high definition screen, but also works via mobile devices.</p>
<p align="center"><hr style="width:200px"></p> 
        <p>
Imagine enjoying from your bed the view of the distant lights of Kuta & Seminyak flickering on the far shores of the bay then in the morning as you wake up without raising your head from your pillow being able to see the waves breaking down the reef along Bali's Uluwatu Peninsula and the sight of the Mount Agung volcano towering over the distant Seminyak shoreline. </p><p>
Enjoy a morning shower or bath using the islands finest herbal amenities while watching the early surfers catch waves in what seems to be just outside your bathroom window. After a gourmet breakfast on the deck of the rain forest grotto or on the ocean side terrace it's time to walk down a sculptured tropical garden path all the way to your own private entrance to the Indian Ocean for a refreshing swim or surf, first stopping at the waters edge antique carved pergola to check the conditions at Padang2 Beach just a stone throw away on the right hand side of you, or if you prefer stay back at the house and immerse yourself in the private white marble infinity pool under the shade of a lush green banyan tree, a body work session at the fully serviced in-house spa, or read a novel in one of the many luxurious settings. 
</p><p>
These are but some of many combinations of wonderful visuals and luxury experiences you may encounter in a full day at The Luxe Bali, a residence built with the utmost care down to every micro detail and convenience, passionately built over 9 years to provide the ultimate in comfort, ascetics and facility for the most discerning and observant of guests capable of appreciating fine facilities, comfort, ambience, and service. The Luxe Bali is one of only three residences within an expansive private gated estate containing lush tropical grounds not unlike those generally thought of in Ubud, with several unique pools,  rock ponds, pergolas and entertaining areas extending all the way from the road to the stairs at the very waters edge. </p><p>
The Estate collectively offers so much more that what would normally be available in a one-residence location, while maintaining the utmost of personal privacy and discretion for each residence and it's guests. The Luxe Bali was designed and constructed with the goal of creating a residence that compliments & reflects the awe inspiring views and unique location we are so fortunate to humbly be graced with. We could do no less with such a special setting and because of this a residence comparable to any of the words finest estates was born. 
</p><p>
We have no doubt that your expectations will not only be met, and in most if not all cases amply exceeded for even the most fastidious of travellers already well versed in the finer elements in life. Our team of friendly respectful staff are there to assist your every beck and call yet not visible until needed. The fine dining rising far beyond the average upmarket villa standard enables you to dine in the comfort of your private residence and enjoy the fine dining experience most others would need to go out to achieve. To date this has been the experience of every single guest that has stayed with us and frequently mentioned in  their recommendation letters. In the words of one guest well versed in luxury lifestyle, The Luxe Bali is not a high end villa in the normal sense of the word, it more closely resembles a super yacht parked on one of the most stunning vistas imaginable. In attempting to convey the above we realize how hard if not impossible it is in words and photo's to fully convey how unique & beyond The Luxe Bali really is.</p>
